Your response goes here!

What new skills have you learned?
    Certain html5 tags to describe its meaning to the browser and the development. Which means we use them to give semantic to our projects.

    tags like:
        • <main>
        • <header>
        • <article>
        • <strike>
        • <sup>
        • <cite>

What has been easy?
    Understanding the definition of tags and the structure of a simple html page.

What has been difficult?
    At this point I've been enjoying the videos and documentation and I haven't found troubles yet.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    Thinking in the tree concept whenever I'm building a webpage has helped me to have a plan based on the structure of the full content. Which I think will be useful when the projects get bigger, this way I'll be able to think before taking a wrong path.
